This is meant to be a first introductory post. I have a PhD in mathematics, I work in an actuarial role, and I have been trying to learn more about machine learning (statistical learning), the umbrella term "AI", as well as current computational trends. In an attempt to document my learning journey and to challenge myself, I decided to attempt to put my notes (or at least some of them) on github. I'm hoping this will be a good way to learn, collaborate, and document some of my interests. I will attempt to properly cite all of my sources. I am also open to suggestions.
